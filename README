CHOICE(1)                   General Commands Manual                  CHOICE(1)



NAME
       choice - small menu utility

SYNOPSIS
       choice [-i initial] [-s scope] item item ...

DESCRIPTION
       This  manual  page  explains  the MorzelBlues choice utility.  It is an
       easy to use menu utility to select an item from a  list.   choice  sup‐
       ports  the  arrow-keys and the vi(1) movement keys for toggling between
       items, uses stand-out or reverse mode for the  currently  selected  and
       uses  dim  or  underline  mode  for  the  not  selectable items.  A not
       selectable item proceeds with an exclamation-mark or number-sign.   The
       selected item is written to standard error.

OPTIONS
       -i initial
              start off with initial as the currently active item.

       -s scope
              set the scroll scope.

EXAMPLE
       A  small example of a Bourne-shell-script which stores `Yes' or `No' in
       the variable `ans':

              ans=$(choice '#REALLY?' Yes No 2>&1 > $(tty))

       And a C-shell example:

              set tty = `tty`
              set ans = `(choice '#REALLY?' Yes No > $tty) >& /dev/fd/1`

SEE ALSO
       dialog(1), termcap(5), vi(1)

DIAGNOSTICS
       Exit status is 0 if no error occurred. In a  non-zero  case  the  error
       message  is  written  to  standard  error.  choice writes the currently
       selected item on RET or nothing on ESC or q to standard error.
